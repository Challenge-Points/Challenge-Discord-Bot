This file just contains cogs which interact with the challenge points api. Why did I seperate all the functions into their own cogs and put these cogs into a seperate file? good question.
Anyway going to dump some links here so I can easily access them again in the future.

https://challenge-points-dev.herokuapp.com/api/stats/all - Stats
https://challenge-points-dev.herokuapp.com/api/maps/all - Get's all maps
https://challenge-points-dev.herokuapp.com/api/users/(userid)/data - Get a single user


Alright, cya. Hope you have a good day :)
